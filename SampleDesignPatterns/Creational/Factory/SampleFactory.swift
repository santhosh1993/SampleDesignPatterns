/**
    Sample scenario is for a kinfe Store.
 
    Store can have multiple varient of knifes. Lets categorise them into two major varients
    1. Budget
    2. Quality
 
    So now our KnifeFactory sould be capable of creating a knife objects according to the requirements speceified. So, we have subclassed KnifeFactory to BudjetKnifeFactory and QualityKnifeFactory. As we have mentioned its a fatalerror method, so the subclasses has to overide those methods to add there respective functionality. By this we have divided the concrete creational to factory creational pattern.
 
    We get advatege in long run if there is any change in initialisation only the factory menthod will change as all creation is happening at only factory.
